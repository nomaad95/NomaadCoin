# NomaadCoin

This project is a basic C++ example of a blockchain. First of all an empty blockchain is started. Then a loop is created in which a mining addres validates transactions between 2 other addresses.

## Getting started

* A PC (qui l'eut cru) running on Linux

* G++ compiler

## Deployment

  * In the root folder run <code>make</code>

  * Run the project with <code>./main</code>

## Information

This Makefile needs to create .o files to compile the project. You can get rid of all those .o files by typing <code>make clean</code> in the root folder.
